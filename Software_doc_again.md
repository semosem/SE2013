>### Introduction 

<p>At some point in our life, we all have wished if we could hear a magic direction whispered to our ear after getting in a situation where we couldn’t find a way to a particular destination inside a building. It’s frustrating, especially if we have to get to the place we want to go in an emergency cases. These situations are much worse and very serious issues when they involve healthcare service providing hospitals, as a patient or as a family of an injured person it might be necessary to get the service required immediately.

<p>This problem has inspired us to come up with idea of designing a “way finding” System for a certain health care center that uses touch screen standing kiosks and their interactivity nature. We believe that his system we are building will provide a step-by-step directions and distance- time information to patients and visitors of Hayat Hospital.
This Private Hospital named Hayat hospital is formerly a government hospital located in Addis Ababa Ethiopia and is infamous for having a huge departments and facilities but a weak information service. 

The kiosk system requires a web browser with good support of standard web Technologies – HTML 4, CSS 2, JavaScript, DOM, XML and XSLT. Also browser should have possibility to play back audio files either built in or via external plugin and run Java applets, because printing will be implemented using this Technology.
The system is also expected to introduce neat patient-flow, a significant increase in on-time appointments, improved patient experience and by providing a more efficient use of staff time and can reduced costs considerably.

>### User Requirement Definition
